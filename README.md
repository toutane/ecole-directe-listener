## 💭 The Project

The idea of this project is as follows: send a notification to your mobile when one of your teachers gives you a new grade, puts you some work to do or sends you a message on the [Ecole Directe] platform.

Indeed, this platform allows schools like mine to communicate and share information with its students via a site and an app. This is useful during periods of confinement when pupils do not go to school, for example 😉. However, [this app] with a slightly old-fashioned look and poor performance does not send you notifications when new information appears 👎.

This project starts from this observation. It would be useful for the student to be notified of any new event related to his account. This project solves this problem 👍. Download the app on your mobile, log in with your Ecole Directe credentials, start listening to your account and that's it! the application will send you a notification as soon as you have additional work, a new message or a new note.

## 🏄‍♂️ How it works (basically)

As the Ecole Directe platform does not offer an API for listening to modifications in the establishment's database, it was necessary to find a solution to allow us to know when new data appeared in the student's account.

The solution: regularly check for changes and notify the user when there is one.

Thus, EDL regularly makes requests to Ecole Directe to ask it "Did Charles-Antoine get a bad note?" No kidding... I only have good grades 😏.

To see if there is a change between a query n and a query n + 1, Ecole Directe Listener stores in mLab for each listening the data of query n and compares it with the new data of query n + 1, if it are different: it sends you a notification, otherwise the process continues. Attention, even if there are changes, nothing stop 👌.



## ⚙️ How it works (more precisely)

Although this project allows me to respond to a real need, it also allows me to manipulate different techonologies and to play with them, in particular through the APIs that they offer. Among these are:

* **[Expo]** and **[React Native]** for the development of the app, the client side
* **[Vercel]** and its **[serverless functions]** for the backend part
* **[mLab]** for keeping the data of the current listening
* **[Easy Cron Jobs]** for the periods between each request to Ecole Directe
